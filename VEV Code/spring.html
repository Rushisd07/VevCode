<h2>Spring - DI</h2> 
    (Dependency Injection == Inversion Of Control(child of DI) - IOC)

<b>Features of Spring:</b>
    - POJO based.
    - Plug-ins are very easy.
    - Transaction Management
    - Data Access

<b>What is Spring Container ?</b>
    - Manages the life cycle of an object.
    - Wires objects automatically.(Unique to spring)(link different object automatically).
    - Spring Container represented by the Interface ApplicationContext.

<b>Types of Spring Container :</b>

    - BeanFactory	--- Interface
    - Application	--- Interface

    <b>Note:</b>
    - Application Represents an Advanced Spring Container
    - ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is a class that is used to load the xml file (Configuration)From the default class path
    - it is used start the spring Container.


<b>More use case : </b>
    - payment(Credit card , debit card , upi)
    - account(SA,CA),etc

<b>Types of Injection:</b>
    - Setter Injection (Process of injecting values at runtime via setter methods is known as SI)
    - Syntax :
            &lt;property name=".." value="..."/>    // any Primitive value ( including string ) can be used
            &lt;property name=".." ref="spring bean name" />   // internal Objected can be injected
                
    
    - Constructor Injection:
    - The process of injecting values via constructor at run time is known as CI.
    - Syntax:
            &lt;bean id =".." class="..">
            &lt;constructor-arg index="0" value=".."/>
            //repeat for other properties --- value of index will change

    <b>Note:</b> 
        index="0"  -- refers to the first property to the class
        - the above can be used to inject simple primitive values.
    
            &lt;bean id=".." class="..">
            &lt;constructor-arg index="0" ref="bean id name"/> 		// used to inject a spring bean into another bean

    <b>Autowired:</b>
            - The process of creating and injecting a bean automatically is known as autowired.
            


<b>What is Dependency Injection(DI)?</b>
            - The Process of injecting values at run-time via CI / SI / AUTOWIRED is known as DI.

    Example :
            External Injection of a Bean

                                    Card 	---(Interface)
                                      |
                    -----------------------------------------
                    |                 |                     |
            MC(MAster card)		VC(Visa card)		AE(American Express card)


    // maintainence is easy.
    // &lt;property...> //always behind the scene invokes the setter methods.


<b>What is .properties file and what it contains ?</b>
    //Properties File
    - Simple text file.
    - But the extension is ---- " .properties "
    - it should contain key / values.
        ex: login.user=java
            (key)
            login.password = 1234
            (key)
    - Ease of maintenance related to configuration of files ( DB / Mail Server / Payment / ... )
    - Everything in lower case


    // Integration of XML with properties File			
    - In src create a simple file with .properties extension.
    - create a pojo.
    - In your Configuration file Specify the location of the properties file.<b>(Interview Question)</b>
            ex: &lt;context:property-placeholder location="classpath:login.properties"/>
    - Inject the values from the properties
        ex: &lt;property name="username" value="${logins.username}"/>	//After $ it read as expression language
    - DemoMain read the data   


<b>Annotations:</b>
		
    - They are an alternative to xml.
    - They are java classes either defined in java or frameworks.
    - They are represented by the symbol @ .
    - Types of annotation:

        * default annotation
        * Single valued
        * Multi Valued

    - They simplify coding.
    <b>Note :</b> An annotation should always start with @ followed by Upper case letter


<b>What are stereotype annotation? (Interview Questions)</b>
    - @Component(Parent class)
    - @Repository
    - @Controller
    - @Service


There are 2 things to instruct spring container to enable spring core annotation and scan for the component class.

    &lt;context:component-scan base-package="pkg name only"/>
                //scans the component annotation and creates a bean. (Interview Question // IMP)

    &lt;context:annotation-config/>		- enables spring core annotation.

<h2>Spring DAO ( class + DI )    --- Spring JDBC	( DATA ACCESS OBJECT )</h2>	
    - It encapsulates all data access logic at one place.
    
    - Spring has its own drivers in order to support DI.

        DirverManagerDataSource	( from Spring )
        BasicDataSource	( apache )	
        Many third parties
    
    <b>-Note :</b> Beauty of Spring DAO is ... it allows change of persistence technology using DI
            that is , any change in RDBMS ( Persistence Technology ) is easily supported by
            spring DAO ( DI ).

    
    @Repository
        - Creates a bean for the class.
        - Represents DAL layer. 
        - Identified via component-scan.
        - Child of @Component.

    <b>DMDS</b>(DriverManagerDataSource)
        (Spring own Class for connection)(We can use for any database we don't need to change the class)
        - Different properties present :
                - driverClassName
                - url
                - username
                - password


<b>(Power of Spring)//Spring JDBC</b>

		- It has the following templates
					JdbcTemplate
	
		- Constructors of JdbcTemplate:
			JT()
			JT(DataSource ds)
			JT(DS ds,boolean lazyInit)			

		- Has its own methods to perform CRUD Operations 
		- It has no dependency on JDBC (java.sql/javax.sql)
			
		- Following are the methods to perform CRUD Operations
				
			int executeUpdate(String sql,Object args....)

			// Retrieve a Single Object		
			Object queryForObject(String sql, RowMapper<>,Object args....)

			// Retrieve all the Records		
			List<> query(String sql, RowMapper<>,Object args)

<b>What is the package of datasource and JDBC templates</b>
==> spring has its own datasource and JDBC templates comming from 
        - org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource

        - org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate


=====================================================================================================================

<h2>SPRING MVC</h2>
- (Modern application are based on this mvc.)

	- Used to Process Form Data , Validation, Conversion
	- Flexibility in configuring the view layer. It can be JSP, THYMELEAF(Java +Html) , VELOCITY , FREEMARKER . 
	- Ease of Maintainance of the application.
			
	<b><u>Spring MVC Architecture:</u></b>

</pre>
<img src="images/spring mvc.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

<pre class="para">
    Abbrevation:
        - AIWR:	All Incoming Web Requests.
        
        - FC: Front Controller.
            - It is Represented by the class provided in spring framework. 
            - The FC Class Name is --- "DispatcherServlet"(Interview question)(DS).	
            - Acts like a hub for all the layers.
            - What does FC/DS do?
            - It delegates the request coming from the client to the respective controller.
		
        - RM: REQUESTMAPPING
            - It maps the url pattern of the request to the Controller Method.

        - DR: DELEGATE REQUEST
	
        - C1 / C2 / C3 / CN:
            - They are Bunch of Controllers.
            - They are Annotated by @Controller identified via component-scan.
            - They are Classes responsible to interact with various other layers (Especially SERVICE LAYER).
        
        - M & V : Model and View 

        - LV : Logical View	(abcd.jsp) logical view is "abcd"(file name without extension).
		
        - VR : VIEW RESOLVER
            - It is a class that is represented by InternalResourceViewResolver.(IRVR)
            - It is responsible in converting the Logical view to physical path.
            - It has to be configured in ApplicationContext.xml . 
            - IRVR converts logical view to physical path and notifies the DS(DispatcherServlet).
		
        - PP: Physical Path
		
        - M : Spring Model

        - R : Response   		

<b>- Annotations of Spring MVC:</b>
		
        @Controller
        @RequestMapping("..")
        @RequestParam("..")
        @GetMapping("..")
        @PostMapping("..")
        @ModelAttribute("..")
        @PathVariable("..")
        - Model/ModelMap is an Interface similar to the map.
    
    @ModelAttribute

        - It is used to copy all the form elements data into the bean properties automatically.
        - It basically injects the data from the form into a bean.
        - Note: It can be used only with spring HTML.

=====================================================================================================================

<h2>Spring MVC - ORM</h2>

        - The above allows any ORM Layer to be integrated with spring MVC.
        - DI is Achieved by spring's own classes for ORM layer
    
    @Transactional : enable Transaction management and to avoid repetitive code 
        - Configuration for web.xml would remain the same for the DispatcherServlet and the path of the spring configuration file.

    What is Entity Bean?
		- An Alternative to .hbm.xml File.
		- It is a Bean that Maps the class to the Database Table Name.
		- Also Maps the Properties of the Bean to the Target DB Columns
		- Used to Persist Data across various layers of the application
		- Some of the important Annotations used are:
			- @Entity
			- @Table
			- @Id
   			- @Column
    <b>Note :</b> An entity bean is like a Simple java Class that has Properties / Constructor / Setter / Getter --- but used by Spring ORM
        to Persist Data / perform CRUD Operations with the Target Database

=====================================================================================================================

<h2>REST API (Representational State Transfer)</h2>
    - Alternative Name : Web-Services / Restful Web Services / Restful API	
    - Exchange Data Across Different Technologies.
    - It is Light - Weight.
    - Use Http As a Medium of Transfer.
        
    <b>JSON :</b>
		
        -JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
        - Plain Text.
        - Light Weight
        - Format of JSON
            {
                "NAME":VALUE,
                "NAME":VALUE
            }
        - A JSON Object is Represented By Curly Braces.
        - It Contains Name and Associated Value.
        - Name Should Always be Within Double Quotes.
        - Value Can be Number / Character / String / Nested JSON Objects / Arrays / Boolean .

    - NOTE: Any Language can understand JSON Format.
    - Postman Tool can be used as a client to test REST API.
    - REST API is based on 3 Wheels ---------
                                            |
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------
            |                               |                                   |                                
    <b>Resource / Noun</b>                       <b>Verbs</b>                         <b>Data Representation</b>
        |-Represents URI            |-GET = to fetch data                   |-JSON
        |-End Point                 |-POST = to submit data                 |-XML
                                    |-PUT = to modify data
                                    |-DELETE = to delete data


    - MARSHALLING / UNMARSHALLING (Encrypt and Decrypt).
    - SERIALIZATION / DE-SERIALIZATION.
    - Data Binding :
	    - Conversion of a Java Object to JSON and Converionsion of JSON to JAVA object 
	    - JACKSON Library : Convert JAVA object to JSON and vice versa.  

    @ResponseBody : Annotation is used to print directly whatever you are returning.

    @RestController : Equivalent to @Controller + @ResponseBody	It will print whatever you have returned. ( Interview Que )

    @RequestParam : It is used to capture query parameter.

    @PathVariable : It is used to capture values from the URL path.
