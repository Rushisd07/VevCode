<b>Collection in Java</b> 
        -Any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.
        -The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
        -Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque).
        -Maintain the application easily.
        -collection basically grows and shrinks dynamically.

<b>ArrayList in Collection</b>
        -Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. 
        -Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
        -Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
        -Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
        -Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis.

<b>LinkedList in Collection</b>
        -Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. 
        -It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
        -Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
        -Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
        -Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
        -In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
        -Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

<b>Advantages of collection</b> 
        -We need not to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs.
        -It provides a standard interface for collections that fosters software reuse and also provides algorithms to manipulate them.
        -Reduces the effort required to design and implement APIs by eliminating the need to produce ad hoc collections APIs.
        -It provides useful data structures and algorithms that reduces programming effort due to which we need not to write 
         them ourselves.
        -It provides high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms that increases the performance.
        -Helps in establishing a common language to pass collections back and forth that provides interoperability between 
         unrelated APIs.
        -Collection is resizable and can grow.

<b>Disadvantages of collection</b>
        -It must cast to correct type.
        -It can't be done compile-time type checking.
